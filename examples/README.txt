Examples
--------

These Python scripts illustrate the use of the FreeDiscovery REST and Python
APIs on a subset of the TREC 2009 legal collection. See the README for the
quick start instructions that use `curl`. 

These examples can be run with the following steps,

1. Start the FreeDiscovery server (see "Installation instruction" section of the documentation)
2. Run the examples with Python, e.g. 
     
   .. code-block:: bash

       python examples/REST_categorization.py
