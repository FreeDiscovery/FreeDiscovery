I am repeating this because I don't think everybody got it the first time.
If
you get two copies, I'm sorry, but I wanted to be sure everybody who is
supposed to get it gets at least one copy.

Longhorns Get Huge Longview Offensive Lineman as 12th Commitment
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, of Longview, another star in the outstanding
class of offensive line recruits in the state this year, came to Texas
Saturday with his parents and committed to the Longhorns. He is Texas' 12th
commitment, and that group includes seven offensive linemen.
Young , who already is a full qualifier with a 980 SAT and 21 ACT score,
said
he also had scholarship offers from Miami, UCLA, Notre Dame, Arkansas,
Texas
A&M, LSU, Mississippi State and several other schools. But he said he has
been a Texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a
scholarship by Coach Mack Brown Saturday.
He said he met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nunez.
Drake recruits the Longview area and Nunez is the offensive line coach.
When asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman,
Young
said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial
charge. He said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick
contact and holds his blocks.
"I really like Texas," he said. "They have great coaches and great kids and
they are going to do some great things in the next few years and I want to
be
part of it."
Longview coach Pat Collins, who coached an NCAA Division II national title
team at Northeast Louisiana a few years ago, has seen some top football
players and he says Young "is one of the best high school prospects I have
seen or coached. He has worked really hard this summer and has excellent
mobility and agility. He's a great prospect and a great kid who has really
supportive parents."
For those of you who are disturbed by Young's 40 time, don't worry about
it.
He has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off
speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior. Collins told me
he
is moving Young to guard "because he is a really physical blocker and I
want
to us to be able to run inside better. He can help the team more at guard,
but he could play guard or tackle in college."
The state's top QB prospect, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas
Bishop
Lynch, was scheduled to go to Texas A&M this weekend for an unofficial
visit
with his coach, Gary Oliver, a former Aggie receiver.
But I talked to Nordgren today (Sunday) and he told he didn't get to go to
A&M because Oliver wasn't able to go. He said he planned to take a quick
trip
to Colorado, "but I didn't go to either place. I don't think I'm going to
be
able to go to Colorado now, because coach Oliver and I probably will go to
A&M next weekend and then we'll be starting two-a-days."
Asked if he is getting close to a decision, Nordgren said, "I really like
Texas and I don't think that is going to change. I don't think anyone is
going to beat Texas."
I will be very surprised if he doesn't commit to Texas immediately after
returning from his A&M visit.
Texas' 12 early commitments  include seven offensive linemen. In addition
to
Young, the OLs are Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to
Texas), Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey
Village, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls
and
Alfio Randall of Blinn JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal
Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric
Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian
Carter of The Woodlands.

RECRUITING NOTES: Incoming UT QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands is impressing
everyone at the workouts for the North-South High School All-Star Game. It
will be at Rice Stadium Tuesday night and Mock has been looking great
rolling
out and throwing on the run. I have seen him throw the ball about 80 yards,
and he threw it with some zip, too, so there is no question about his arm
strength. Athlete Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest has already been impressing
the UT defensive backs in voluntary summer workouts and he also is looking
great at WR and DB in the North-South workouts.
